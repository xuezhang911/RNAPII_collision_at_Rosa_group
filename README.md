- 👋 Hi, I’m @xuezhang911, I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Plant biology department in Swedish University of Agriculture Sciences
- 👀 I’m interested in epigenetics regulation in gene expression and transcription coordination in single cells
- 🌱 I’m currently working on investigating about how transcription is coordinated at overlapping convergent gene pairs in single cells;
To address this study, I mainly use bioinformatics analysis approaches to select gene pairs of our interest and smFISH techniques to inspect their transcription in situ. From different bioinformatics analysis, I have accumulated experience in analyzing different bulk stranded RNAs-seq, bulk ChIP-seq and will also need to analyze scRNA-seq data lately. 
With the requirement of postdoc project , I have attended or joined multiple training courses organized by SciLife NBIS platfrom and Swedish University of Agriculture Sciences: 
(1) Introduction to bioinformatics using NGS data
(2) Epigenomics Data Analysis: from bulk to single cell
(3) Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis (From 30 Jan. 2023)
(4) Introduction to statistical learning
(5) Analysis of High Throughput Sequencing RNA-seq

Meanwhile, I have developed smFISH on plant cryosections, a method allowing us to detect and visualize RNA at single locus level in different tissues under microscopy imaging with preservation of tissue morphology. Inspired by obtaining the spatial gene expression map of RNA  in tissues, I would love to contribute to the omics develpopment on spatial biology.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spatial transcriptomics methodology development
