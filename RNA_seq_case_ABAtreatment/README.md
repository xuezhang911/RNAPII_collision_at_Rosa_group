The featurecout table of gene counts from GSE135607 was collected.
 Differentiation of gene expression analysis was performed by DESeq2.
 PCA plot, MA plot, heatmap plot were generated either by ggPlot2 or R base functions. 
From this dataset, I try to find if both NRT1.9 and CDPK1 are higly activated by 3h 50mm ABA treatment in Col0 genotype.
